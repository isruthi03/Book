        <h3 style="margin-right: 120px;">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Good Girl, Bad Blood (2020) is the second novel in the three-part A Good Girl’s Guide to Murder series of young adult crime fiction.
        Pippa Fitz-Amobi has decided to stop being a teen detective. Her first successful “case” was emotionally exhausting. She’s done with the stress and strange looks she gets from being that girl. 
        But then Jamie Reynolds, brother of Pip’s good friend, Connor, goes missing.And the police refuse to do anything. Uggh! Looks like it’s up to Pip to dredge up more dark secrets in the small town of Fairview.

        <b><h2 style="margin-left: 30px;">Summary:</h2></b>
 <h3 style="margin: 20px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pip is not a detective anymore.
    At this point, Pip feels exhausted in ways that you can’t just sleep away. And she simply wants to go back to living a normal teen life: you know, go to school, plan for the future, 
    and maybe have a little time to cuddle with her “sorta” new boyfriend Ravi (brother of Sal, one of the murder victims in the first case).
    But sometimes success has a way of haunting you.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    While Pip attends the community’s outdoor memorial service for the two dead students, she bumps into 24-year-old Jamie Reynolds. He is her friend Connor’s older brother and seems anxious and distracted while everyone else is participating in the ceremony.
     A day later, Connor comes to Pip’s house to say that Jamie has gone missing and the police won’t do anything about it because he isn’t a minor
     The police refuse to get involved because Jamie’s an adult, at 24. But there are suspicious circumstances in the mix: Jamie’s suddenly odd behaviors and bouts of depression; his strange internet searches; a mysterious online beauty; missing money.</h3>

<h3 style="margin: 20px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Pip is reluctant to get involved but finally realizes that she is the only person in a position to help. With Ravi’s assistance, she starts investigating leads to Jamie’s whereabouts. In addition to circulating a Missing poster, 
Pip uses social media to ask schoolmates and townsfolk to send her photos and videos taken on the evening of the memorial. She hopes to spot Jamie in some of these pictures.The interviews reveal that Jamie has a huge crush on Nat (who has a boyfriend btw), he argued a lot with his father, and he went missing during the memorial.
 Joanna also tried to send Jamie a text at 12.30am, but it was undelivered, meaning his phone had been off since at least then.
Pip tries to get into Jamie’s computer but she can’t figure out the password.Pip goes to see Nat and meets her boyfriend, Luke. He’s a bit of a knob. Nat starts to get paranoid that Pip suspects her. Luke says he wasn’t at the memorial (he claims he didn’t leave the house on Friday at all but Nat’s expression may say otherwise), and they kick Pip out.

    Gail Yardley sends Pip a photo with Jamie in the background, which was taken at 8.30pm.Pip finds evidence of Jamie being at the party in some Snapchat stories. She figures out he left the house at 9.56pm.
    Pip sees a photo of Max Hastings at the memorial and Ravi gets understandably upset.
    Pip’s mum finds out that Pip is investigating Jamie’s disappearance. Pip’s mum also says she knows something about Jamie. It turns out he was still telling Joanna he was working at Pip’s mum’s agency. He wasn’t. He was fired because he tried to take the company credit card to use on… something.
    Pip notices that one of the knives at Connor and Jamie’s house is missing.Pip is eventually able to piece together Jamie’s movements that night. When he shows up at a high school house party, it becomes apparent that he is trailing a girl he calls Layla. Pip soon learns that Layla is an internet catfish
    who has been preying on young men in the community. She has used the photo of a real local girl to establish contact and seems to be targeting white males with brown hair who are 29-30 years old.Pip, Connor, and Ravi create a Tinder account to look up this Leila person. They find a profile of someone nearby for someone called Layla Mead and it links to her Instagram. Which their new history teacher follows.
    They message Layla and “she” says “Hello Pip. You’re getting closer.” Which is… creepy.</h3><br>
    <h3 style="margin: 20px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Pip gets onto Jamie’s computer and she’s able to track his movements using his Fitbit tracker. She figures he can’t have walked more than a mile or so, which gives her a radius. Especially as Connor figures the eye witnesses who saw him in a black hoodie could be correct, and Jamie was walking in the opposite direction than previously thought.
Pip also reads Jamie’s messages to Layla. Jamie had lied to “Layla” and told her he was turning 30. He later admitted to lying, and Layla took ages to respond. Eventually Layla asked Jamie if he’d do anything for her and he said he would, and the conversation moved to Whatsapp.Pip organises a search through the woods. Cara’s team finds something and calls Pip over to the farmhouse. They think they’ve found the missing knife, so Pip calls the police.
Arthur, Jamie’s father, speaks to Pip and admits he’s scared for his son. He says that Jamie asked to borrow £900. Funnily enough, Robin let slip that Luke lost £900 last week…
Pip tries to speak to Nat again but Nat refuses.Max Hastings is found not guilty, which is gross. Pip goes to tell Nat, who is devastated.
Pip asks Tom why he lied to her about seeing Jamie. He wanted internet fame so Pip pours a drink over his head.Pip sees a photo of Max Hastings celebrating his victory, and feels even worse. She decides to get her revenge on him by vandalising his house.
She also uploads an audio file of Max admitting his guilt.Nat asks to speak to Pip about Jamie. She says her boyfriend Luke has been talking to Layla Mead and he was seeing her the night Jamie disappeared. Nat shows Pip the messages between Luke and Layla, Luke seemed very angry after supposedly meeting up with her.
Pip talks to Luke and asks why Jamie owes him £900. It’s because Luke lent it to Jamie. Luke admits to going to meet Layla, and then he says that Layla is Jamie. Which obviously does not make sense.</h3>
<h3 style="margin: 20px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
After this conversation, Pip tries to figure out what Jamie could possibly have been talking about when he said “child broomstick” to Luke. She Googles a few things and finds Child Brunswick, 
who was the child in the Scott Brunswick case. Scott Brunswick made his son lure out child victims in Margate, Kent.Pip figures that Jamie was looking for Child Brunswick, and Layla possibly is too.
There’s a subreddit dedicated to finding Child Brunswick, who has been moved about under witness protection. It’s rumoured that he’s in Little Kilton.
After some reading, Pip learns that Howie, the dealer, knew Child Brunswick and has probably been mouthing off. Pip thinks Child Brunswick is Stanley Forbes.
Pip heads to the farmhouse, pretending to Stanley that she’s Layla, and the others head to Stanley’s. They find Jamie there and they get him out. Jamie says he made a deal with Stanley and the others should leave.
Stanley sees Pip at the farmhouse and thinks she’s Layla but she’s obviously not. Pip reassures him that she’s not trying to blackmail him.
Pip promises to help Stanley.
Pip’s neighbours, Charlie shows up. Turns out they’ve been searching for Child Brunswick.He kill Stanley which means pip just witnessed a murder.
Pip attends Stanley’s funeral.Charlie and Flora are now on the run.</h3>
