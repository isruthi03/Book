 <b><h2 style="margin-left: 30px;">Five Years Ago :</h2></b>
 <h3 style="margin: 20px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andie Bell went missing one evening.Sal, Andie’s boyfriend, became a suspect when his friends told the police he had asked them to lie about his alibi.
    He allegedly asked them to say he was at Max Hasting’s house until 12.15, but they said he actually left about two hours earlier.
    Sal later supposedly killed himself after texting his dad a message admitting to the murder.
    Andie’s body was never found and the case was closed.</h3><br><br><br><hr style="height:2px;border-width:0;color:black;background-color:black">
    <b><h2 style="margin-left: 30px;">Present :</h2></b>
    <h3 style="margin: 20px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pip is doing a school assignment on the Andie Bell case. She doesn’t believe Sal was guilty, and is determined to prove it.She determines that, 
        based on the known facts of the case, whatever happened to Andie occurred Friday, April 18, 2014, between 10:40pm. and 12:45am. A few days later, after much police scrutiny,
         Sal was found dead in the woods, presumably having died by suicide—especially after he sent a confession by text, which solidified his guilt in seemingly everyone’s mind but Pip’s.</h3><br>
    <h3 style="margin: 20px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pip goes to speak to Ravi Singh, Sal’s brother, who still lives in Little Kilton with his parents. He is mildly unimpressed with Pip’s project at first.
        Pip speaks to Stanley Forbes, a journalist from the local paper. He doesn’t provide much new info, but he does let slip that Andie received a death threat the week she disappeared.
Pip speaks to Ravi again, and they talk about Sal and the school history teacher, Elliot Ward.
Mr Ward is Pip’s best friend’s father. Cara and Naomi Ward are like sisters to Pip.
Pip talks to Naomi, who says that Sal was at the gathering with Naomi the night Andie disappeared. Naomi says Sal left around 10.30, and Sal’s father said Sal returned home at 12.50. Over a two hour window.
Pip talks to Max Hastings, another friend of Sal’s who was hosting the gathering. Max says Sal didn’t talk about Andie that evening, but Naomi previously said he did.
Pip asks Elliot Ward about Sal. Mr Ward says Sal was super smart and was going to go to Oxford. Mr Ward says he didn’t know Andie, however.
Ravi wants in on the investigation. He brings along Sal’s old phone. They find a text on there to Andie which says “I’m not talking to you till you’ve stopped”.
Another text, the confession, is also still on there. This one doesn’t match Sal’s usual grammar style though.</h3>

style="float:right; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px ; margin-bottom: 5px; border: solid black;"><h3 style="margin: 20px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Nancy’s page, Pip spots photos from the night Andie went missing. She questions who ook the photos, sinc ethe time on Naomi’s phone shows that they were taken past midnight, when Sal was suppsedly gone.
    Pip and Ravi retrace Sal’s steps as if he had left the gathering at 12.10. They figure he couldn’t have murdered Andie, disposed of the body, and returned home by 12.50. Sal was innocent.
    Pip goes to the Ward house. Naomi and Max are there. They admit to lying to the police about what time Sal left because they received a threatening message.
    Max and Naomi were previously involved in a hit and run, and whoever sent the message somehow knew about it and threatened to tell the police unless the friends lied.The suspects are now Howie, Max, Jason, Daniel, Nat, and Elliot.<br><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pip returns home to find someone has been in her room. A note reads “You need to stop this, Pippa”.
    Naomi breaks her phone and starts using Elliot’s spare one.Pip goes to see Becca Bell, who is writing a piece on why it’s a bad idea to renovate the abandoned farmhouse just outside of town.
    Pip asks about the burner phone, and Becca says Daniel da Silva was involved in the initial searches of the house. She says he wouldn’t have done it, and was close to Jason Bell.Pip takes Barney for a walk and he goes missing.
    Pip receives a message from Unknown, asking her if she wants her dog back. Unknown tells Pip to destroy her laptop and all her research on the case.
    Pip does so, but Barney is found drowned in the river.</h3><br>
    <h3 style="margin: 20px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pip goes round to the Ward house and is ready to accuse Naomi but then it turns out the phone and number are Elliot Ward’s.
        Pip checks out the printer and finds out that it did print one of the notes – the one from the locker.
        Ravi and Pip work out that Elliot is probably not tutoring and may be visiting Andie three times a week because he has her locked up.Elliot admits to sleeping with Andie, to trying to get her to stop, and to arguing with her the night she disappeared. She tripped, and she hit her head on the desk. She left shortly after.
        Elliot panicked when he learnt Andie was missing, and he killed Sal to frame him.
        Later, Elliot saw Andie walking along the main road, picked her up, and locked her in the house in Wendover.
        Pip goes to the loft and finds the girl, who isn’t actually Andie. She’s a young woman from Milton Keynes who now believes she is Andie because that is what Elliot has been telling her.
        Elliot is arrested.</h3><br><br><h3 style="margin: 20px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pip is still thinking about where Andie really is, since Elliot didn’t kill her.
            Pip figures it was Becca Bell. She heads over there.
            Becca spikes Pip’s drink and admits to killing Andie. Andie came home that night and Becca tried to tell her she had been drugged and assaulted but Andie didn’t care.
            Becca got angry and they argued, and Andie fell and started convulsing. She eventually choked on her own vomit.
            Becca put Andie’s body in the septic tank of the abandoned farmhouse.Becca tries to kill Pippa but can’t do it in the end. Ravi and Pip’s dad arrive in time. Becca and Max are arrested.
            Pip gives a really nice speech and Ravi gets to clear his brother’s name.</h3>
